### Javascript HTML Calculator (Windows Clone) ###

With this exercise, I had the oportunity to put in practice every basic knowledge that I learned during the last month, like:

- Working with OPP (Object Oriented Programming) and classes (Atributes and Methods);
- Basic overview of MVC (Model-View-Controller);
- DOM Manipulation;
- Conditional laces (Switch, For and ForEach);
- Loop Conditions (If, else if);
- CallBack and Arrow Functions;
- Programming logics;

The intention is to improve this project as I go deeper into the programming.

### Know Issues ###
- Error when trying to plus 2 float numbers;
- Displaying 2 decimals even when the number is integer;
- Equal button is not repeating the last operation;
- Arrow button is not working yet.
